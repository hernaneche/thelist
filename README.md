####The List (Poetry)

There could be too many lists  
which all of them contain the same    
filled with growing empty lakes  
with a nothingness bigger than themselves    
  
What sets the lists is not in there     
but hidden choices were reserved  
it all depends on what you care   
and if you dare to descend    
  
In some lists, it's near the door    
in others too far to be found   
all those destiny filled words    
are different ways disposing one
