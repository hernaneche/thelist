##P vs NP problem##
###Improbable but possible###
Trying to guess a meaningful number within a list in the hope of finding some useful information is a so improbable bet that it's faster to put a whole universe to evolve than to find a piece of art, or any useful information by doing exponential search or lucky guessing it on a list, but strangely enough, it's not impossible.  
So we know it's naive to try to guess from the list an answer to a problem or question with no clues, it's ridiculously improbable, if it were easy we could get out of there some texts, pictures, sounds, movies, science,...we can't, but **how do we actually get all these things?**  

###Hard for whom?###
The usual answer is that things are made by evolution, by quantum reality, or in more mundane terms by work, by inspiration, by real life experience, and so on.. At this point let's introduce the P vs NP problem.  
We know that nothing explicitly *forbid us* to solve a particular NP problem by getting its result from a hat ( a non deterministic Turing machine, like hitting a correct number from the list) and later verify the answer with an algorithm in P. That's roughly how we define NP problems, hard to solve easy to verify. But the word 'hard' is only meaningful if we try to solve it with a deterministic algorithm, assuming that the option of "computing the result" is as difficult as testing all the possibilities, it's a slow option that doesn't scale well, so saying NP to be 'harder that P' by definition explicitly excludes *magical* ways of solving it by *guessing correctly*, so if the oracle option is not an option, then we say, it's harder than P.  

###P are natural-born NP###
Ask it again, how do we actually get all things? We do not know if there is a metaphysical perspective from which we are the output of some algorithm in P (in P seen from that meta point of view); but we can be sure that from our perspective it's not the case, our problems are not in P, not only in general, but even none of them start in P. Why? because even if a problem can be solved by an algorithm in P, we first have to discover that algorithm! then adding up the "operations" of discovering it, and of running it, the resulting algorithm to do both things is not in P because is not even deterministic in the first place.   
Anyone can learn how to sum a many digit numbers with a known method in P, but we should remember that today's known things, like the numeral system with its positional notation, didn't came with us, but evolve with us, so those inventions were crafted through experiences, and today they can make some problems really simpler than without them (at expenses of making others be more complicated of course); so our today's numbers, symbols and methods, as the standard addition algorithm, have been discovered through evolution, non-deterministic inspiration, which made ​​it possible to have them in P today. Our culture and genes are more than memoizing some of our NP problems to make them P.       
We could complain at this point by saying : evolution takes too much freedom in solving problems, while P and NP is a more specific bounded question valid for models of computation like Turing computers, but if so, we could also ask where did we get the concept of computation? where did we get the model and computers in the first place? and what are computers made from? what are mental models made from? I suspect none of these can be obtained from an algorithm in P.  
We could insist in saying that there is no need to trace the origin of something, to ask a question about it, but P vs NP is not a question about something, but a question about all questions, so for this infinitely broad question, I felt comfortable giving, at least, an infinite answer.
  
###Sources of clues ###
I hypothesize that every single particular problem can be set and solved through evolution but not all at once (we can even solve the problem of creating a problem that is hard to solve, or that can't be solved, in a given context), whenever we face a problem we receive clues via non-deterministic experiences ( non-deterministic from our point of view, regardless of whether they were super-determined or not, in any case we perceive them as having some randomness ). Our everyday life experience is a fated confrontation with non-deterministic clues, call them noise if you like, but they can't be avoided, and while trying to avoid them, as we try sometimes within maths or computers or language, we face problems whose solution is very hard and considered intractable, it makes sense! it's *because* we forbid those clues, is a autoboicot to sustain the game: we are allowed ourselves to take the problem statement and language from the noise, of our non-deterministic history and existence, *but* when it comes to tackle the problem, we carry it out into a toy world with the pretensions of being formal, fixed and controlled, that is to say: we allow informal noisy things to be the source of our theories and problems but once formalized we try to limit the use of those sources to solve them, that's so unfair!. 

###Learning###

A student is trying to solve a math test problem (for example calculating the area behind a curve), we could say that the problem is in NP for him, because he knows no method to solve it, although the problem were in P for the teacher that knows calculus. He was finally able to solve it by copying the answer from a classmate (copying a student with good grades is like getting data from a non-deterministic oracle).  
The teacher could say that copying the answer was a prohibited tool, which is very reasonable, forbidding actions for *tests* is ok, it also mimics constraints, always found in real problems, but there is no way to learn without getting non-deterministic data, creating as learning *is* to get non-deterministic data, so in NP by definition, then non-deterministic approaches are a *need* for creating and learning. Learn is to gain non-deterministic ways of seeing a problem deterministically. 

###General, particular, dynamic###
Perhaps *our general problems* are not an issue that matter to the evolution but some of *our particular* problems surely are; evolution is patient and can reach *her general things* from particular steps, including our steps. So,  if evolution, or existence, randomness, universe, you name it, can solve any particular issue that *she* cares about, perhaps so we do, as long as we get her way of doing things, getting interested in *particular* problems and allowing ourselves to use non-deterministic experiences as clues, that could make a problem in NP, becomes P. 
On the other hand, *general* problems (big numbers, not to mention infinite) although are too much for us to *solve*, they are also useful as an inspiration source. The advice could be: don't confuse them.      

If through time we can get a solution out of a hat to every single particular problem in NP that were put in front of us (but of course not all at once, i.e. no NP-complete), but any problem in NP will tends to become P as evolution time tends to infinity.
