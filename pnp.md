##P vs NP problem##
###Improbable but possible###
Trying to guess a meaningful number within a list in the hope of finding some useful information is a so improbable bet that it's faster to put a whole universe to evolve than to find a piece of art, or any useful information by doing an uninformed blind search or lucky guessing it, but strangely enough, it's not impossible.  

OK, guessing right is ridiculously improbable, but **how do we actually get all these things after all?**  

###Hard for whom?###
The usual answer is that things we know are made by evolution, even universe evolution, there are other mundane equally confusing terms by remembering what works, by inspiration, by thinking, by working, by real life experience, and so on.. 
Into the P vs NP problem, we know NP problems are *hard* to solve *easy* to verify, nothing explicitly *forbid us* to solve a particular NP problem by getting its result from a hat and later verify that answer with an algorithm in P, that magic hat is often called a non deterministic Turing machine, it's hitting a correct number from the list of numbers. But the word 'hard' is only meaningful if we try to solve it with a deterministic algorithm, and when testing all the possibilities is not an option, considered a slow option that doesn't worth, and doesn't scale well, when the oracle and waiting are not options, then NP is harder than P. 

###P are natural-born NP###
Ask it again, how do we actually get all things? We do not know if there is a metaphysical perspective from which reality is the output of some meta-algorithm in meta-P (P seen from that meta point of view); but we can be sure that from our perspective it's not the case, in general, our problems are not in P, even more, none of our problem can born in P. Why? because even if a problem can be solved by an algorithm in P, we first have to discover that problem and that algorithm!, its domain, its language, and so on, then adding up the "operations" needed for discovering it, and running it, the resulting 'algorithm' to do both things is not in P, because the first part is not even deterministic. 
Anyone can learn how to sum a many digit numbers with a known method in P, but we should remember that things we know today, like the numeral system with its positional notation, didn't came with us, but evolve with us, so those inventions were crafted through experiences, and today they can make some problems really simpler than without them, perhaps at expenses of making others be more complicated; the numbers, symbols and methods, used by our today's culture, as the standard addition algorithm, have been discovered through evolution, it is non-deterministic inspiration, which made it possible to have them in P today.  
Our culture and genes are doing its magic (more than memoizing) to turn some of our NP problems into P problems. 
We could complain at this point by saying : evolution takes too much freedom in solving problems, while P and NP is a more specific bounded question valid for models of computation like Turing computers, but if so, we could also ask where did we get the concept of computation? where did we get the model and computers in the first place? and what are computers made from? what are mental models made from? I suspect none of these can be obtained from an algorithm in P.  
We could insist in saying that there is no need to trace the origin of something, to ask a question about it, but P vs NP is not a question about something, but a question about all questions, then for this infinitely broad question, I felt comfortable giving, at least, an infinite broad answer.
  
###Sources of clues ###
I hypothesize that every single particular problem can be set and solved through evolution but not all at once, we can of course also solve the problem of creating a problem that is hard to solve, or that can't be solved in any given context, but not in every context, whenever we face a problem we receive clues via non-deterministic experiences,  non-deterministic from our point of view, regardless of whether they were super-determined or not, in any case we could perceive them as having some randomness. Our everyday life experience is an interaction, a fated confrontation with non-deterministic clues, call them accidents, or noise if you like, but they can't be avoided, and while trying to avoid them, as we try sometimes within maths, computers, language,  culture, we face other problems whose solution is very hard and considered intractable, it makes sense! it's *because* once we determine game rules, we forbid those clues, a self limitation to gain control, to sustain the game: it's like this, we seem to allow ourselves to take the problem statement and language from that noise, accidental evolved way from ur non-deterministic history and existence, *but* when it comes to tackle the problem, we carry it out into a limited toy world with the pretensions of being fixed, controlled and formal, to avoid flaws, that is to say: we allow informal noisy things to be the source of our problems and theories but once formalized we try to solve them, without the use of those non-deterministic sources, that's so unfair!. 

###Learning###

A freshman is trying to solve a math test problem (for example calculating the area behind a curve), the problem is in NP for him, because he knows no method to solve it, although the problem is in P for a teacher that knows calculus. He could finally solve it by copying the answer from a classmate (copying a student with good grades is like getting data from a non-deterministic oracle).  
The teacher could say that copying the answer was a prohibited tool, which is very reasonable, forbidding actions for *tests* are ok, and also mimics constraints that are always found in real problems, but on the other hand there is no way to learn without getting non-deterministic data, in creating, as in learning non-deterministic data is mandatory, learning *is* to get external non-deterministic data, it's in NP by definition (measuring is non-deterministic), non-deterministic approaches are *required* for creating and learning. We could define learning, as to gain non-deterministic ways of seeing a problem deterministically. 

###General, particular, dynamic###
Perhaps *our general problems* and whims are not an issue of nature, nothing that matter much to the universal evolution, but some of *our particular* problems surely are; evolution is patient and can reach *her general things* from particular steps, including our steps. So, if evolution, or existence, randomness, universe, you name it, can solve any particular issue that *she* cares about, perhaps so we do, as long as we get her way of doing things, it is getting interested in *particular* problems and allowing ourselves to use non-deterministic experiences as clues, that could make a problem in NP becomes P, and of course not now, but through time. 
For our *general* problems as big numbers, general methods, not to mention infinite things, although are too much for us to *solve* them, as long as we don't confuse them with particular concrete problems, they are an inspiration source. 

Through time we can get a solution out of particular hats to every single particular problem in NP that were put in front of us, of course avoiding the pretension of solving all at once, i.e. giving up NP-complete whims, then any problem in NP will tends to become P as evolution time go by, then new NP problems will come, NP->time->P, stay tuned, because it's also life what lies in the middle arrow.
