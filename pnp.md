##P vs NP problem##
###Improbable but possible###
Trying to guess a meaningful number within a list of possibles in the hope of finding some useful information like music, science, images, movies, is terribly unlikely, is a so improbable bet that it's faster to put a whole universe to evolve rather than find a piece of art, or any useful information by doing an uninformed blind search or lucky guessing it, but strangely enough, it is not impossible.  

Guessing right is ridiculously improbable, so **how do we actually get all these things after all?**  

The usual answer is that real things don't come easy either, as we know things are made by evolution, even by an evolution of the physical universe, there are also other mundane and equally confusing terms : by inspiration, byre interaction, by thinking, by working, by preserving what works and eliminating what doesn't, by real life experience, and so on.. 

###Hard for whom?###
It depends, into the jargon of P vs NP problem, solutions for P kind of problems scale well with input size, and for NP problems it's the verification of the result the only thing that scale well, but how to get those results for NP problems in the first place? we don't know, and is there a posible solution that scale well? we don't know, so NP problems seems to be *hard* to solve and *easier* to verify, although still nothing explicitly *forbid us* to solve a *particular* NP problem by getting its result from a hat, we can later verify that answer with an algorithm in P, except that we have no magic hat, we don't have a a non-deterministic Turing Machine, it is a fast hitting machine of the right solution from the list of all posibles. So the word 'hard' is only meaningful if we try to reach the result with a standard deterministic algorithm, that's where NP problems are 'hard', where input size matter, if there is no oracles availables, if testing all the possibilities is not an option or it's considered a too slow option, if taking too long is frowned, there is where NP is harder than P. 

###P are natural-born NP###
So ask it again, how do we actually get all things? We can theorize about a super metaphysical perspective from which reality is the output of some meta-algorithm in meta-P (it is P seen from that meta point of view); ok, but from our perspective that it's not the case, in general our problems are not in P, even more, none of our P problem have been born in P. Why? because we first have to discover the problem, its domain, its language, and so on, so adding up the "operations" needed for discovering it, and then running it, is a procedure that is not in P, because the first stage is not even deterministic. 
Anyone can learn how to sum a many digit numbers with a known method in P, but we should remember that things we know today, like the numeral system with its positional notation, didn't came with us, but evolve with us, so those inventions were crafted through experiences, today they can help simplify our problems, perhaps at expenses of making others be more complicated; so the numbers, symbols and methods, used by our today's machines and culture, as the standard addition algorithm, have been discovered through evolution, it is from non-deterministic inspiration, experiences, unsolvable by any algorithm, that inspiration was necessary so that we have them in P today.  Whatever it is, is doing its magic, and it's turning some of our NP problems into P problems. Whatever it is, evolution, universe, you name it, what is running culture to genes, its magic is more than memoizing.
We could complain at this point by saying : "evolution takes too much freedom in solving problems, while P and NP is a well defined an dmore specific bounded question, valid for models of computation like Turing Machines", we could still ask ok, so where did we get the concept of computation and computers in the first place? what are computers made from? what are mental models made from? and so on, I suspect none of these models can be obtained from an algorithm in P!
We could insist in saying that there is no need to trace the origin of something, or to ask a question about it, but also P vs NP is neither a question about something, but a question about all questions, so for this infinitely broad question, I felt comfortable giving, at least, an infinite broad answer.
  
###Sources of clues ###
I hypothesize that every single particular problem can be set and solved through evolution but not all at once, we can of course also solve the problem of creating a problem that is hard to solve, or that can't be solved in any given context, but not in every context, whenever we face a problem we receive clues via non-deterministic experiences(non-deterministic from our point of view, regardless of whether they were super-determined from above or not ), in any case we could perceive them as having some nondeterministic surprise and randomness. Our everyday life experience is full of interaction, a fated confrontation with non-deterministic clues, call it environment, accidents, or noise if you like, but they can not be avoided, and while we try to avoid them, as we fix rules within maths, computers, language, culture, etc.. we face other new problems whose solution is very hard and is considered intractable, it makes perfect sense!! it's *because* once we determine game rules, we forbid those external clues that crete it, as a self limitation to gain control, to sustain the game: we seem to allow ourselves to take the problem statement and language from accidental evolved ways from our non-deterministic history and existence, *but* when it comes to tackle the problem, we carry it out into a limited toy ruled world with the pretensions of being fixed, controlled and formal, to avoid flaws, we allow informal noisy things to be the source of our problems and theories, but once formalized we try to silence that world, we try to solve it all within the theory, without the use of those non-deterministic sources, that's very unfair. 

###Learning###
Imagine a freshman trying to solve a math test problem (for example calculating the area behind a curve), the problem is in NP for him, because he knows no method to solve it, but can easily check the result from the teacher, although the problem is in P if someone who knows calculus. He could also solve it by copying the answer from a classmate, copying a student with good grades is like getting data from a non-deterministic oracle.  
The teacher could say that copying the answer was a prohibited tool, which is very reasonable, forbidding actions for *tests* are ok, and also mimics constraints that are always found in real problems, but on the other hand there is no way to learn without getting non-deterministic data, in creating, as in learning the non-deterministic part of data is mandatory, learning *is* to get external non-deterministic data, it's in NP by definition, the very act of measuring is non-deterministic, so non-deterministic approaches are *required* for creating and for learning. Learning some technique is like gaining non-deterministic tools, non-deterministic ways of seeing a problem, deterministically. 

###General, particular, dynamic###
Perhaps *our general problems* and whims are not an issue of nature, nothing that matter much to the universal evolution, but some of *our particular* problems are surely aligned with hers; evolution is patient and can reach *her general things* from particular steps, including our steps. So, if evolution, or existence, randomness, universe, you name it, can solve any particular issue that *she* cares about, perhaps so we do, as long as we are part of it, and as long we get her way of doing things, it is by getting interested in *particular* problems and by allowing ourselves to do whatever, and use non-deterministic experiences as clues, that could make a problem in NP becomes P, not now, but slowly through time. 
For our *general* problems as general methods, big numbers, not to mention infinite things, are too much for us to *solve* them, but they are an inspiration source, as long as we don't confuse them with particular concrete problems. 
Through time we can get a solution out of particular hats to every single particular problem in NP that were put in front of us, of course avoiding the pretension of using a deterministic computer, or the worse pretension of solving all at once, like in P=NP, i.e. we should give up NP-complete whims (although the search itself is inspiring) not all at once, but any particular problem in NP will tends to become P as evolution time go by, and then new NP problems will come, NP → time → P, but stay tuned, because it's also our life what lies in the middle arrows.
