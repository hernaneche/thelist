##Some people related with the list##
---
####Leibniz  
 
As in many other areas of knowledge, G. W. Leibniz has also thought already about this issue, in his essay "*De l’Horizon de la Doctrine Humaine*" (1693) he proposes two options, on one side, as our written history can't be outside the list, and because of our finitude, if human existence time were long enough (let's say >N years) it's required for history to have repeated parts; as a second option he proposes future beings going beyond actual humanity, pushing our limits, changing our upper bound of perception.
 

-*"the human race will not always remain in the same state, since it is not in keeping with the divine harmony to always play the same chord."* 

It seems that Leibniz have a lot to tell us, and that we should *get back to Leibniz*, but that's a wrong way to say it, because in fact, we have never reached him. 

   
####Georg Cantor
He managed to find a way to compare the "amount" of natural numbers (the infinite set of all natural numbers) with the "amount" of Real numbers (another infinite set), concluding that there are infinitely many more Real numbers.

####Kurt Gödel 
He does not have much to do with *this* list, but he indeed create a list, a numbering system, tagging any possible *statement* within a system with a unique natural number, then properties of those statements (for example the property of being true or false) would end being also properties of those numbers, and so on. But instead of UTF-8, Gödel used a system based on prime factorization,  Gödel admired Leibniz as we do, so he would be pleased to be mentioned in context with him.

####Leopold Kronecker
Because of this quote from him : "God made the integers, all the rest is the work of man."

####Jorge Luis Borges
He wrote "La biblioteca de babel", a story very related with the list, he was also a Leibniz reader.

####Roman Opałka   
He paint a list of numbers (for years!) so he really deserves to be here.

####The Matrix Movie
There is no direct reference to the list there, but any possible matrix like universe will be also on the list.
