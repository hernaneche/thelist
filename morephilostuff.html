<h2>More philosophy stuff</h2>
<hr />
<h4>A list</h4>
<p><strong>There is already</strong> a definite number for any possible input, and there is no need to <em>store</em> all possibles but it's enough to generate on demand when you summon it, <em>the number is enveloped in the algorithm</em>, so it's implicit defined, even <em>before</em> we input any data, a number can index a book or a picture without having to ever input that data, i.e. we could get a book with no need to of a writer... well, the problem is how to know that number? that's not easy, but just possible, indeed if you insert a book data, it will reveal which number it <em>was</em>, but the number has been around forever, already there but hard to guess.</p>
<h4>Outside the list</h4>
<p>Any perceivable phenomenon could be represented through symbols (of course <em>after</em> the known experience) so a symbolic recording, although different from its source reality, could be indistinguishable from it. Then we can not experience or create things outside a certain <em>amount</em> of possibles, it's a big space, but not infinite, so every possible distinguishable fits on a list.</p>
<p>We could imagine that everything <em>is already</em> on a list of possible realities, waiting there, even before anyone develop or experience them, before we all were born; regardless of us. </p>
<p>No thing can exist nor happen that is not already on the list</p>
<p>The bad news (or good depending on your view) is that <em>most stuff on the list is incurably incomprehensible; between any item and its explanation, there are far more unexplained things. Understand everything, is an oxymoron.</em></p>
<h4>Interpreters and many lists</h4>
<p>Can we talk about a list of <em>perceivable</em> things without regard to <em>who or what</em> perceives it?   </p>
<p>Any possible being that has a enough finite perception to even be called perception (and being), will be bounded by a custom list of possibles.</p>
<p>Of course as integral living beings itself we can not fit on the list (not even all numbers can!), indeed we can talk <em>about</em> anything, but we cannot <em>talk anything</em> (we talk words, we don't talk an icecream for example, let alone a universe..). It's perfectly possible to think about other beings, other lists, and things outside the list, there the list reveals itself incomplete, subjective, and so on, and it's clear that the list doesn't have <em>absolutely</em> everything indeed, but it has anything, all for you, for me, and for everyone; that's all folks.  </p>
<p>In some sense, every list is the same list.</p>
<h4>Arguments 'against the list'</h4>
<p>Somebody could say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Reality is not a reproduction, even if under certain circumstance we can confuse special effects with reality, like a bird hitting a mirror, we can still distinguish the past from the future, &quot;the list&quot; does not include our time, then sorry &quot;list&quot; but I can recognize pretty well when I'm getting older!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and of course the classical one, from Heraclitus </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But don't worry, the list is big enough to handle it all, the list doesn't have time, it's right, but it has the whole history of any man, of any river and the changes over them, so before judging about <em>changes</em> in a river or in a man, we should be able to ask if those were a river or a man in first place.</p>
<p>Send your own complain!</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The very idea of posibble outcomes is as old as humanity can remember, so we can't list every person ever say something about it, anyway <a href="./peoplerelated.html">here another incomplete list of people related with the list</a>.  </p>
