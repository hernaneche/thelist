 ..the number of possible public histories of the world
       which differ from each other is limited
            and does not exceed the number N.

<h3 id="A.list">A list</h3>

<p><strong>There is already</strong> a definite number, for any possible input, there is no need to <em>store</em> all possibles, it&rsquo;s enough to generate them on demand when you summon it, <em>the number is enveloped in the algorithm</em>, it&rsquo;s implicit defined, even <em>before</em> we input any data, a number can index a book or a picture without having to ever input that data, i.e. we could get a book with no need to of a writer.  Well, not so fast, the problem is how to know that number in advance? that&rsquo;s not easy, but possible, just slightly possible; indeed if you insert a book data <em>then</em> it will reveal which number it <em>was</em>, and that number has been around forever, already there but very hard to guess.</p>

<h4 id="The.list.has.anything..does.it.has.everything.">The list has anything, does it has everything?</h4>

<p>How many things we can recognize as being different things?. We are limited, in time, space, and also in the degree of detail we can perceive, then with a great enough digital resolution in a virtual &lsquo;realism&rsquo; experience, we are not able to distinguish it from any other upper resolution experience, neither from any other reality. Given enough details there is finally a threshold, where there is no further distinction we can do.</p>

<p>Our limits in perception, memory, reasoning and lifetime outline this upper bound, how many colours, how many concepts, how many books, how many songs, paints, movies, or any invention that we could possibly make, then all the experiences any human can ever have are limited within a finite number of possibilities that despite being huge, is still finite as we are. So a list doesn&rsquo;t need to be unbounded to have it everything.</p>

<h4 id="Outside.the.list">Outside the list</h4>

<p>Any perceivable phenomenon could be in principle be represented through symbols (of course <em>after</em> the known experience) a symbolic recording that, although different, could be reproduced indistinguishable from its source reality. Then we can only experience or create things inside a certain <em>amount</em> of possibles, a big space, but not infinite, every possible distinguishable fits on a list.</p>

<p>We could then imagine that everything <em>is already</em> on a list of possible realities, waiting there, before anyone develop or experience them, before we all were born; regardless of us. No thing can exist nor happen that is not already on the list.</p>

<p>The bad news (or good depending on your view) is that it&rsquo;s perhaps easier to evolve a whole universe than finding things on the list by chance, <em>*most stuff on the list is incurably incomprehensible; between any item and its explanation, there are far more unexplained things.</em>  Understand everything, is an oxymoron.</p>

<h4 id="Interpreters.and.many.lists">Interpreters and many lists</h4>

<p>Can we talk about a list of <em>perceivable</em> things without regard to <em>who or what</em> perceives it?</p>

<p>Any possible being that has a enough finite perception to even be called perception (and being), will be bounded by a custom list of possibles.</p>

<p>Of course as integral living beings itself we can not fit on the list (not even all numbers can!). It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to think about things outside any list and other beings, their lists, and so on, the list reveals itself incomplete, it do not have <em>absolutely</em> everything indeed, but it can has <em>anything</em>, that&rsquo;s all for you, for me, and for everyone; that&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

<p>In some sense, every list is the same list.</p>

<h4 id="Arguments.against.the.list">Arguments against the list</h4>

<p>Some ladies and gentlemen could call me saying</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Reality is not a reproduction, even if under certain circumstance we can confuse special effects with reality, like a bird hitting a mirror, we can still distinguish the past from the future, "the list&rdquo; does not include our time, so  sorry for &ldquo;the list&rdquo; but it lacks of time, and I can recognize pretty well when I&rsquo;m getting older!"</p></blockquote>

<p>and quote the classical one, from Heraclitus</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it&rsquo;s not the same river and he&rsquo;s not the same man&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, the list is big enough to handle it all, the list doesn&rsquo;t have time, that&rsquo;s right; but it has the whole history of any man, of any river and the changes over them, so before judging about <em>changes</em> in a river or in a man, we should be able to ask if those were a river or a man in first place.</p>

<p>Send your own complain!</p>

<h3 id="History.of.the.concept">History of the concept</h3>

<p>The very idea of posible outcomes is as old as humanity can remember, so we can&rsquo;t list every person ever say something about it, anyway <a href="./peoplerelated.html">here is another incomplete list of people related with the list</a>.</p>
