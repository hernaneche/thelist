<h3>What is The List?</h3>
<p><br>
A connection between <em>data</em> and <em>numbers</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input any <em>data</em> &#8594; get an unique <em>number</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input any <em>number</em> &#8594; get the <em>data</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data could be texts, images, sounds, programs, files, etc. </p>
<p>Between ironic and serious, this list aims an insight over distinguishable things, and the very scope of our own power of distinction in general. </p>

<h2>What's in a number?</h2>
<p>Any natural numbers is defined to be different to any other, that's it, they can be uniquely identified, so each represents any possible distinct data, texts, sound, pictures, videos,.. then any data can be coded into a number.</p>
<h2>The list has anything, does it has everything?</h2>
<p>We are limited, not only in time and space, but also in the degree of detail we can perceive, there is a threshold, i.e. given enough details there is no further distinction we can do; for example, with a great enough digital resolution in a virtual 'realism' experience, we are not able to distinguish it from any other upper resolution, neither from any other reality. </p>
<p>Our limits in perception, memory, reasoning and lifetime outline this upper bound in how many things we can recognize as being <em>different things</em>, how many colours, how many concepts, how many books, how many songs, paints, movies, or any invention that we could possibly make, then all the experiences any human can ever have are limited within <strong>a finite number of possibilities</strong> that despite being huge, is still finite as we are. So a list doesn't need to be unbounded to have it everything.</p>
<p>We could say everything is on the list, as we could say there are things that are not there, but both are fictions.</p>
<h3>About authorship</h3>
<p>-<em>What’s an author?!</em> How can the concept of an author even exist if anything can be found by counting, with no creator?  </p>
<p>-Authors naturally meet those numbers faster than any method, that's how authors are defined, even though they themselves are a domino of a larger process.</p>
